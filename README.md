# ⏰ Talking Clock – Accessible Android App

Talking Clock is an Android app developed in Java using Android Studio. It is designed specifically for individuals with disabilities to help them manage their daily schedule with ease and independence. The app speaks the time aloud using text-to-speech, allows users to set alarms, and provides both visual and audio cues tailored for accessible interaction.
